# React-Notes-2

## Hello World, Part II... THE COMPONENT
React applications are made out of components.

# What’s a component?

A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML.

Take a look at the code below. This code will create and render a new React component:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
A lot of that code is probably unfamiliar. However you can recognize some JSX in there, as well as ReactDOM.render().

We are going to unpack that code, one small piece at a time. By the end of this lesson, you’ll understand how to build a React component!

# Create a Component Class

You’ve learned that a React component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job, which often involves rendering HTML.

Here’s another fact about components: we can use a JavaScript class to define a new React component. We can also define components with JavaScript functions, but we’ll focus on class components first.

All class components will have some methods and properties in common (more on this later). Rather than rewriting those same properties over and over again every time, we extend the Component class from the React library. This way, we can use code that we import from the React library, without having to write it over and over again ourselves.

After we define our class component, we can use it to render as many instances of that component as we want.

What is React.Component, and how do you use it to make a component class?

React.Component is a JavaScript class. To create your own component class, you must subclass React.Component. You can do this by using the syntax class YourComponentNameGoesHere extends React.Component {}.



# Example

 import React from 'react';
 import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';


class x extends React.Component {

}

ReactDOM.render(
	<MyComponentClass />, 
	document.getElementById('app')
);

# Render A Component
You have learned that a component class needs a set of instructions, which tell the component class how to build components. When you make a new component class, these instructions are the body of your class declaration:

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component
{ // everything in between these curly-braces is instructions for how to build components

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
This class declaration results in a new component class, in this case named MyComponentClass. MyComponentClass has one method, named render. This all happens via standard JavaScript class syntax.

You haven’t learned how these instructions actually work to make components! When you make a component by using the expression <MyComponentClass />, what do these instructions do?

Whenever you make a component, that component inherits all of the methods of its component class. MyComponentClass has one method: MyComponentClass.render(). Therefore, <MyComponentClass /> also has a method named render.

You could make a million different <MyComponentClass /> instances, and each one would inherit this same exact render method.

This lesson’s final exercise is to render your component. In order to render a component, that component needs to have a method named render. Your component has this! It inherited a method named render from MyComponentClass.

Since your component has a render method, all that’s left to do is call it. This happens in a slightly unusual way.

To call a component’s render method, you pass that component to ReactDOM.render(). Notice your component, being passed as ReactDOM.render()‘s first argument:

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
ReactDOM.render() will tell <MyComponentClass /> to call its render method.

<MyComponentClass /> will call its render method, which will return the JSX element <h1>Hello world</h1>. ReactDOM.render() will then take that resulting JSX element, and add it to the virtual DOM. This will make “Hello world” appear on the screen.
